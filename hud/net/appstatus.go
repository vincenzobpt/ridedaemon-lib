// Phone-to-car mirroring state.
//
// ECP_P2C_APPSTATUS_BACKGROUND is the one command the official app pushes at the
// phone's own initiative around a mirroring session, and it is the only statement it
// ever makes to the head unit that a mirror now exists. Everything else on this
// channel is dash-originated: the dash asks, the phone answers cmd+1.
//
// From the EasyConn SDK inside the CarbitRide APK (kh/b.java, cmd 131120 = 0x20030),
// the body is
//
//	{"mode":n,"displayRotation":r,"width":w,"height":h,
//	 "enableAccessibility":b,"enableAOAHid":b}
//
// and the app sends it twice per connection:
//
//   - net.easyconn.carman.vf.s.b0(), the moment PXC comes up, with the mode that
//     describes the phone as it is then - normally 2, "not mirroring";
//   - net.easyconn.carman.common.base.n0.setTrueMirror(), which runs when
//     REQ_RV_DATA_START has been answered 113 and the phone has actually started
//     producing frames, with mode 1.
//
// Mode 1 is therefore the phone saying "the picture you are pulling is live". No
// reference implementation sends this - not open-cflink, not open-cfmoto, not
// open-cfmoto-zanderp - and neither did this daemon, which is why it is here: a head
// unit that runs its whole EasyConn client, opens the video socket, pulls every frame
// at 30 Hz and paints none of it is what a UI that was never told the mirror went live
// looks like from this side.
//
// The command is even, so the dash owes it a cmd+1 (0x20031), and y0's own
// getResponseProcessType puts 0x20030 in the SyncExecute group - the official app
// waits for that ack. That makes the ack a free readout: a log with 0x20031 in it says
// this firmware knows the command, whatever the panel does.
